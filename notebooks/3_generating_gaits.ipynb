    "# Generating gaits\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step in developing the robot kinematics is to generate various gaits. First, lets familiarize ourselves with the concept of gaits. Gait is a coordinated sequence of movements of the robot legs and body to achieve smooth locomotion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gait cycle of a hexapod robot refers to the sequential movement of its six legs to achieve locomotion. It consists of two main phases for each leg:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Stance Phase – The leg is in contact with the ground, providing support and propulsion as it moves backward relative to the body.\n",
    " 2. Swing Phase – The leg lifts off the ground, moves forward, and prepares for the next stance phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an idea of the variance and complexity between gaits, Fig 1. shows four typical gaits. The six legs, right and left hind, middle and front, indicated as RH, RM, RF, LH, LM, and LF, at any one time are either on the ground pushing forward (supporting) shown in white, or in the air moving up to their next position (recovering) shown in black.

    "\n",
    "Fig 1. Four typical hexapodal gaits, depicting each of the six legs as either supporting (white) or recovering (black). Image source: (Chen et al. 2012)\n",
    "\n",
    "The two most common gaits for hexapods are the tripod gait and the ripple gait. The tripod gait is a simple gait where the robot legs move in two groups of three, lifting one group of three legs at a time. While the ripple gait is a more complex gait where the legs move in a wave-like motion, lifting one leg at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tripod gait\n",
    "\n",
    "The tripod gait is a simple gait where the robot legs move in two groups of three:\n",
    " - group A: left-front, right-middle, and left-back\n",
    " - group B: right-front, left-middle, and right-back.\n",
    "\n",
    "while one group is in stance phase, the other group is in swing phase and cycle repeats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets build the simplest tripod gait generator, it will generate offsets for each leg at a specific phase (0.0 to 1.0)."

    "This gives a nice forward locomotive gait. However some changes are needed to the generated gait. Right now it starts with legs on the ground, but with maxed out X offsets. To mitigate this we need to introduce a transition stage that will take legs from whatever position they are in to the starting position.\n",
    "\n",

    "This gives a nice forward locomotive gait. However it is forward only and there is no control over the direction of the movement. It is possible to move backwards by reversing the phase interpolation, but it would be nice to be able to control direction using the vector. This way this gait generator can be used with real robot and joystick control.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Directional Gait Decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to add direction to the generated gait, we can create a decorator class that will take the generated offsets and apply a rotation to them. This way we can control the direction of the movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TL;DR\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a 2D rotation matrix that aligns the offsets (originally along the X-axis) with an arbitrary direction vector $[dx, dy]$. The rotation matrix that achieves this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "dx & -dy\\\\\n",
    "dy & dx\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Works\n",
    "\n",
    " - Original offsets are along the X-axis, meaning they can be represented as $[x, 0]$.\n",
    " - A A standard 2D rotation matrix for an angle $\\theta$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "R=\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta\\\\\n",
    "\\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    " - The unit direction vector $[dx, dy]$ corresponds to the cosine and sine of some angle, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "dx = \\cos\\theta\\\\\n",
    "dy = \\sin\\theta\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    " - Substituting these into the rotation matrix gives us the desired transformation matrix.\n",

    " 1. Allow defining a gait trajectory.\n",
    " 2. Allow defining a gait sequence.\n",

    "Gait trajectory are fairly straightforward and we have seen some solution using trigonometrical functions and polynomials already. Gait sequencing has been formulated mathematically before, however it can be expressed as phase offsets per leg. Each phase starts with lift and ends with push. By offsetting the leg phase we can define the sequence.\n",

That is a task for a [smoothing spline functions](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/tutorial/interpolate/smoothing_splines.html), e.g. a [B-spline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline).
