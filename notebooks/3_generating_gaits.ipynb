    "# 3. Generating gaits\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step in developing the robot kinematics is to generate various gaits. First, lets familiarize ourselves with the concept of gaits. Gait is a coordinated sequence of movements of the robot legs and body to achieve smooth locomotion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gait cycle of a hexapod robot refers to the sequential movement of its six legs to achieve locomotion. It consists of two main phases for each leg:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Stance Phase – The leg is in contact with the ground, providing support and propulsion as it moves backward relative to the body.\n",
    " 2. Swing Phase – The leg lifts off the ground, moves forward, and prepares for the next stance phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an idea of the variance and complexity between gaits, Fig 1. shows four typical gaits. The six legs, right and left hind, middle and front, indicated as RH, RM, RF, LH, LM, and LF, at any one time are either on the ground pushing forward (supporting) shown in white, or in the air moving up to their next position (recovering) shown in black.

    "Fig 1. Four typical hexapodal gaits, depicting each of the six legs as either supporting (white) or recovering (black). Image source: (Chen et al. 2012)\n",
    "\n",
    "The two most common gaits for hexapods are the tripod gait and the ripple gait. The tripod gait is a simple gait where the robot legs move in two groups of three, lifting one group of three legs at a time. While the ripple gait is a more complex gait where the legs move in a wave-like motion, lifting one leg at a time.\n",

    "This gives a nice forward locomotive gait. However some changes are needed to the generated gait. Right now it starts with legs on the ground, but with maxed out X offsets. To mitigate this we need to introduce a transition stage that will take legs from whatever position they are in to the starting position.\n",
    "\n",

    "### TL;DR\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a 2D rotation matrix that aligns the offsets (originally along the X-axis) with an arbitrary direction vector $[dx, dy]$. The rotation matrix that achieves this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "dx & -dy\\\\\n",
    "dy & dx\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- Original offsets are along the X-axis, meaning they can be represented as $[x, 0]$.\n",
    "- A A standard 2D rotation matrix for an angle $\\theta$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "R=\\begin{bmatrix}\n",

    "\\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "- The unit direction vector $[dx, dy]$ corresponds to the cosine and sine of some angle, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "dx = \\cos\\theta\\\\\n",
    "dy = \\sin\\theta\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "- Substituting these into the rotation matrix gives us the desired transformation matrix.\n",

    "\n",
    "With the current approach we have achieved decent results and it helped us to get a basic understanding of gaits generation, however it has a serious limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. It is not possible to transition between gaits as they are implemented as separate classes\n",
    " 2. There is no transition in and out of the gait from standing position.\n",
    " 3. Different gaits have different trajectories, however the only thing that has to change is the order in which legs are lifted.\n",
    " 4. Phase logic is mixed with trajectory logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets rework the code to address all these issues and have production ready solution we will use in the next notebook that will be taking all we have learned so far to real ROS implementation controlling a simulated robot in Gazebo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our new approach should satisfy the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Allow defining a gait trajectory.\n",
    " 2. Allow defining a gait sequence.\n",
    " 3. Allow defining a gait generator function that will combine the two above given a set of parameters.\n",
    " 4. Allow steering, turing and transitioning between gaits and positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gait trajectory are fairly straightforward and we have seen some solution using trigonometrical functions and polynomials already. Gait sequencing has been formulated mathematically before, however it can be expressed as phase offsets per leg. Each phase starts with lift and ends with push. By offsetting the leg phase we can define the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to achieve transitioning we need to implement trajectory interpolation. The simplest approach would be to use linear interpolation, however it may create jerkiness cause by sudden trajectory changes causing high deceleration and acceleration. Much better results can be achieved using [smoothing spline functions](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/tutorial/interpolate/smoothing_splines.html), e.g. a 2nd degree [B-spline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline). B-spline allows a smooth transition between control points while remaining stable if some of the control points are changed, e.g. when new goal point is added. 2nd degree B-spline has continuous first derivative, which means that the velocity is smooth and has no sudden changes in direction."
