# Note: C/C++ does not support path-based filtering when using the manual build mode. The "paths" and "paths-ignore" configuration properties will have no effect for this language. If desired, you can use the advanced-security/filter-sarif Action to rewrite the SARIF file to exclude alerts from these paths.
