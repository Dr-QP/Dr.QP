# Migration from Matplotlib to Plotly - All Notebooks

## Files Created
1. `plotting_plotly.py` - Replaces `plotting.py` with Plotly equivalents for 3D visualization
2. `gait_generators_plotly.py` - Replaces `gait_generators.py` with Plotly visualization methods
3. `smoothing_splines_plotly.py` - Replaces `smoothing_splines.py` with Plotly visualization
4. `inline_labels_plotly.py` - Replaces `inline_labels.py` with Plotly equivalents
5. `plotting_plotly_ik.py` - Replaces plotting functions for inverse kinematics visualization

## Files Modified
1. `3_generating_gaits.md` - Updated imports and plotting code to use Plotly
2. `parametric_gait_generator.py` - Updated to use Plotly version of GaitGenerator
3. `1_getting_started_with_robot_ik.md` - Updated imports and plotting code to use Plotly
4. `2_affine_transforms.md` - Updated imports and plotting code to use Plotly
5. `3_1_appendix_smoothing_splines.md` - Updated imports and plotting code to use Plotly

## Key Changes

### 3D Visualization
- Replaced matplotlib's 3D plotting with Plotly's 3D scatter and line plots
- Improved interactivity with native Plotly zoom, pan, and rotation controls
- Enhanced visual appearance with better default styling

### Animation
- Replaced matplotlib's FuncAnimation with Plotly's frames-based animation
- Added interactive sliders for better control of animations
- Improved performance for complex animations

### Gait Visualization
- Updated gait sequence visualization to use Plotly subplots
- Enhanced leg trajectory visualization with better color schemes
- Improved readability of plots with better layout and styling

### Spline Visualization
- Updated spline plotting to use Plotly's line and scatter plots
- Enhanced derivative visualization with better styling
- Improved interactive control of spline parameters

### Inverse Kinematics Visualization
- Updated leg plotting with Plotly's line and scatter plots
- Enhanced angle annotations with Plotly's custom annotations
- Improved Cartesian plane visualization with better styling

### Bezier Curve Visualization
- Updated Bezier curve plotting to use Plotly's line and scatter plots
- Enhanced control point visualization with better styling
- Improved interactive control of curve parameters

## Benefits of Migration
1. **Better Interactivity**: Plotly provides native interactive features like zooming, panning, and hovering
2. **Improved Aesthetics**: Modern, clean visual style with better default colors and styling
3. **Better Performance**: More efficient rendering of complex 3D scenes and animations
4. **Web Compatibility**: Plotly visualizations work well in web environments like Jupyter notebooks
5. **Easier Customization**: More intuitive API for customizing plot appearance
