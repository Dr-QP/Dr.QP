    "# Getting Started With Robot Inverse Kinematics (IK)\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first guide in the series of getting started with Dr.QP robot Inverse Kinematics (IK).\n",
    "In this guide, we will cover the basics of IK and how to use it to control a robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Inverse Kinematics?\n",
    "Inverse Kinematics (IK) is a technique used in robotics to determine the joint angles required to achieve a desired end-effector position. It is the process of solving the inverse problem of forward kinematics, which calculates the end-effector position given the joint angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is Inverse Kinematics Important?\n",
    "Inverse Kinematics is important because it allows robots to perform complex movements and tasks. By calculating the joint angles required to reach a specific position, robots can navigate their environment and interact with objects more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use Inverse Kinematics\n",
    "To use Inverse Kinematics, you need to have a model of your robot's kinematics. This model includes the lengths of the robot's links and the joint angles. Once you have this model, you can use it to calculate the joint angles required to achieve a desired end-effector position."

    "It has a 3 degrees of freedom and consists of 3 links: coxa, femur and tibia and 3 joints: alpha, beta and gamma."
