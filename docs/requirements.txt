# Requirements to build the Python documentation
#
# Note that when updating this file, you will likely also have to update
# the docs/constraints.txt file.

# The Sphinx version is pinned so that new versions that introduce new warnings
# won't suddenly cause build failures. Updating the version is fine as long
# as no warnings are raised by doing so.
# Keep this version in sync with ``docs/conf.py``.
sphinx~=8.2.0

sphinx-notfound-page~=1.0.0

# The theme used by the documentation is stored separately, so we need
# to install that as well.
sphinx_rtd_theme>=3.0.2
