## Downloads

Most of the current designs make a heavy use of links in Fusion 360 which unfortunately prevents export in f3d format (as documented in in [this support article](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Unable-to-export-Fusion-360-model-in-f3d-format-when-only-f3z-file-format-is-offered.html))

All the designs are available for download in STEP format, with only a couple of parts available as f3d.
