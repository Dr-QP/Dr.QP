# Cursor Customizations

This directory mirrors the repository's GitHub Copilot customizations so they
are discoverable in Cursor.

Source of truth:
- .github/agents
- .github/skills
- .github/instructions

Cursor shims:
- .cursor/agents: lightweight agent stubs that reference the source agents
- .cursor/skills: lightweight skill stubs that reference the source skills
- .cursor/rules: Cursor rule files that mirror the instruction content

Keep these in sync when updating the .github sources.
