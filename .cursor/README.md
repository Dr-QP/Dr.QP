# Cursor Customizations

This directory mirrors the repository's GitHub Copilot customizations so they
are discoverable in Cursor.

Source of truth:
- .github/agents
- .github/skills
- .github/instructions

Cursor symlinks:
- .cursor/agents -> .github/agents
- .cursor/skills -> .github/skills
- .cursor/rules: Cursor rule files that mirror the instruction content

Keep these in sync when updating the .github sources.
