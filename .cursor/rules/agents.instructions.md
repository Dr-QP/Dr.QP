# Custom Agent File Guidelines (Cursor)

This rule is a lightweight shim. The full guidance lives at:
`.github/instructions/agents.instructions.md`.

Before creating or editing any agent file, read the source file and follow it.

Key reminders:
- Include required YAML frontmatter (description/name/tools/model as needed).
- Keep instructions specific, structured, and scoped.
- Use handoffs sparingly and only to existing agents.
