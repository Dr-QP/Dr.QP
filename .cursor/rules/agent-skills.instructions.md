# Agent Skills File Guidelines (Cursor)

This rule is a lightweight shim. The full guidance lives at:
`.github/instructions/agent-skills.instructions.md`.

Before creating or editing any skill file, read the source file and follow it.

Key reminders:
- Keep the SKILL.md frontmatter accurate (name/description/license).
- Write descriptions using the WHAT/WHEN/KEYWORDS pattern.
- Reference bundled resources with relative paths.
